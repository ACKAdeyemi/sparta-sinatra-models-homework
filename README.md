# Sparta Sinatra Models Homework

## Task:

To ues what was taught in the Sinatra Models Intro to create a SQL database, populate the table and create a website that is able to make requests to and from the database using the 7 RESTful routes.

## Challenges:
I found it quite difficult to choose input types on my form as I was thinking about the real implications it could have to, for instance, have a number type that is unlimited for a field that would send data to the database that could cause issues due to human error/malicious behaviour.
